### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Joey Piccola. I'm an infrastructure automation engineer focusing on immutable infrastructure through code. I love what I do!

- ðŸ”­  Iâ€™m currently working on...

  - Advanced usages of Terrafrom ðŸŒ¿ / ðŸŒŠ.. You can track my work in this area by checking out my [homelab-terraform](https://github.com/joeypiccola/homelab/tree/master/terraform) repo!
  - Chocolatey CI\CD packaging ðŸ“¦
  - More of an on-gong project, I continue to find services to run in Docker at home (moving to Kubernetes soon!). This work can be viewed here: [homelab-docker](https://github.com/joeypiccola/homelab-docker).

- ðŸŒ±  Iâ€™m currently learning Kubernetes deployments with Helm. This work can be seen here: [homelab-kubernetes](https://github.com/joeypiccola/homelab/tree/master/kubernetes/apps).

- ðŸ’¬   Ask me about my Ansible work with Cisco and Ubiquity. My entire homelab \ home network is all in code! If you're interested you can checkout my network role tasks here: [ansible-network-role](https://github.com/joeypiccola/homelab/tree/master/ansible/roles/network/tasks).

- âš¡  Fun fact about me: I enjoy electronics tinkering. I've made several weather stations from RaspberryPi's and ESP type micro-controllers. Written in either Arduino or Python, they send their stats to InfluxDB where the data is then viewed in Grafana.
